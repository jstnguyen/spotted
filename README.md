<p>This website is designed for students who are looking for most accessible spots on campus. By implementing AI/ML technology, it is the most effective and real-time updates for all users. On the app, users have the ability to rate their study spaces anonymously which creates a recommended space for users that are not sure where to study next. Users can spend less wandering and more time stuyding.</p>
